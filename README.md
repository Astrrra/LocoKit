# ArcKit

Location and activity recording framework for iOS.

## Examples 

### Short Walk Between Nearby Buildings

The orange segments are locations that ArcKit determined to be stationary. The blue segments indicate moving. Note that 
locations inside buildings are more likely to classified as stationary. This allows location data to be more 
easily clustered into "visits".  

| Raw (red) + Smoothed (blue) | Smoothed (blue) + Visits (orange) | Smoothed (blue) + Visits (orange) |

### Tuk-tuk Ride Through Traffic in Built-up City Area 

Location accuracy for this trip ranged from 30 to 100 metres, with minimal GPS line of sight and
significant "urban canyon" effects (GPS blocked on both sides by tall buildings and blocked from above by an elevated 
rail line). However stationary / moving state detection was achieved to an accuracy of 5 to 10 metres. 

Although difficult to see at this zoom level, the filtered and smoothed locations also removed significant noise and 
jitter from the low accuracy raw locations path. 

Note: The orange dots in the second screenshot incidate "stuck in traffic". The third screenshot shows the "stuck" 
segments as paths.

## Features

- Kalman filtered and dynamically smoothed location, motion and activity data
- High resolution, near real time stationary / moving state detection, with accuracy up to 5 metres, and reporting 
delay between 6 and 60 seconds
- Lots more I need to fill in hereâ€¦

## Installation

`pod 'ArcKit'`

## Demo Apps

- To run the demo app from this repository, do a `pod install` before building
