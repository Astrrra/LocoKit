/**
 The device's location moving / stationary state at a point in time.

 ### Outdoor Accuracy

 The slowest detectable moving speed varies depending on the accuracy of available location data, however under typical
 conditions the slowest detected moving speed is a slow walk (~3 km/h) while outdoors.

 ### Indoor Accuracy

 Most normal indoor movement will be classified as stationary, due to lack of GPS line of sight resulting in available
 location accuracy of 65 metres or worse. This has the side benefit of allowing indoor events to be clustered into
 distinct "visits".

 ### iBeacons

 A building fitted with multiple iBeacons may increase the available indoor location accuracy to as high as 5
 metres. In such an environment, indoor movement may be detectable with similar accuracy to outdoor movement.
